## YOUTUBE Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)| Python 

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Business Problem

Youtube was founded in 2005 and has grown to become the second largest search engine in the world (behind Google) that processes more than 3 billion searches per month.

For new creators, it's hard to understand why one video gets lots of views and others don't. There are many "myths" around the success of a Youtube video, such as getting more likes or comments, or if the video is of a certain duration.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

In this project my aim is to explore statistics of a successful Data Science Youtube channel to gain some insights on this topic which might be useful.

Steps of this project:
- Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for the channel (this includes several small steps: create a developer key, request data and transform the responses into a usable data format)
- Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis
- Exploratory data analysis


#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
