## YOUTUBE | EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
### 1. Aims, objectives and background
Youtube was founded in 2005 and has grown to become the second largest search engine in the world (behind Google) that processes more than 3 billion searches per month.

For new content creators, it is a challenge to understand why a video gets video and others do not. There are many "myths" around the success of a Youtube video, for example if the video has more likes or comments, or if the video is of a certain duration.

I decided to gain some insights on this topic which might be useful for new content creators. The scope of this project is limited to one data science channel and I will not consider other niches (which may have different characteristics and audience base). So, in this project we will explore statistics of a successful data science Youtube channel.

### 2. Steps of the project
- Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for a channels in the data science niche (this includes several small steps: create a developer key, request data and transform the responses into a usable data format)

- Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis

- Exploratory data analysis

- Conclusions
